## **NOTA BENE**<br>
#### This concludes our HTML-CSS course.

The best way to test your skills is to work on your project!
No doubt, you are intimidated by the amount of information received but you have to take one problem at a time.<br>

Here are the steps :

### 1. Create a hierarchy of your content
The purpose of this step is to structure your content into categories (a.k.a. menus).<br>
A good tool for this job: https://www.gloomaps.com

### 2. Create a wireframe (or mockup) of your layout *(optional)*
The purpose of this step is to define what zones and elements you have on a page. You'll need a mockup for each page you have.
The best tools are pen and paper. But, you can use also a tool like this online editor: http://framebox.org

### 3. Design inspiration
Please don't try to "invent" a design. The web design is a standalone profession, it takes years to master.<br>
A better way is to find a design you like and it's appropriate for your content. There are **A LOT** of web sites out there for design inspiration. Here are some of them :
* https://html5up.net/
* https://www.siteinspire.com/
* https://www.awwwards.com/websites/

Study the design you choose! What fonts ?, what text size ? what colors ? what line-height ? what element dimensions ? Try to **respect exactly what you see**, it's simple and accurate.

### 4. Create the site file structure
Look at the file structure of the [Twenty](https://github.com/powercoders-lausanne/support/tree/master/HTML-CSS/Twenty/site-END) website for inspiration. Or to this ["Mini Page"](https://github.com/powercoders-lausanne/support/tree/master/HTML-CSS/09.mini-page).<br>
You must name the first page of your site "*index.html*".<br>
Name your file/folders without spaces or/and special characters

### 5. Convert the design into HTML-CSS
If your design is delivered with code, **DO NOT** just copy the code, you will learn little.<br>
Take screenshots of the design and try to convert it into HTML-CSS by yourself. **This is how you learn!**

Use these Chrome extensions to speed-up the process:
 - [Full page screen capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en) - Take  screenshots of a website
- [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/emliamioobfffbgcfdchabfibonehkme) - A tool to measure sizes and distances
- [ColorZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp) - A color picker tool

### 6. Create a beautiful and meaningful code
Remember, it's important to organize and to comment your code.<br>
Again, look at the [Twenty](https://github.com/powercoders-lausanne/support/tree/master/HTML-CSS/Twenty/site-END) website for inspiration, we tried to follow today's best code practices for HTML/CSS.

Remember: 
- All your pages must have a title
- Be coherent, always use the same order for your meta and links in your document `<head>`
- The HTML tags must have a semantic sense. When you have a title use `<h1>`,`<h2>`,... tags. When you have a footer use the `<footer>` tag and so on.<br>
Submit your HTML to your trainers and ask them if you've done good.
- The CSS code order :
  1. Start with a RESET or NORMALIZE.
  2. Styles for the main tags (html, body, h1, h2, p, a, etc.)
  3. Helper classes styles (you will add more later)
  4. Styles for the common layout elements (like the menu)
  5. Styles for particular elements

### This is just the beginning
Even if we finished this course this doesn't mean we'll not talk again about HTML/CSS. Almost all the courses in this program are HTML/CSS based. You'll get better and better at this job. You just need time and practice.
